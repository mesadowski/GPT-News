# GPT-flask
This is a kind of mashup between a news reader and ChatGPT. I started with a Flask tutorial from Digital Ocean and modified it so that instead of storing and displaying blog posts, we grab a news feed from CNN, ask ChatGPT to read it using the ChatGPT API, and then ask ChatGPT to use segue to a (hopefully funny) sales pitch for a product.
